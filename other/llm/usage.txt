Make this look better


ChatGPT:
To improve the appearance of the ggplot plot, we can add enhancements such as a more descriptive title, axis labels, color adjustments, and better formatting. Here's an improved version of the code:

r
ggplot(data, aes(x = date, y = marriage_licenses)) +
  geom_line(color = "#2C3E50", size = 1.2, alpha = 0.8) +  # Thicker line, custom color
  geom_point(color = "#E74C3C", size = 2, alpha = 0.8) +   # Add points for better visibility
  labs(
    title = "Marriage Licenses Over Time",
    subtitle = "An overview of trends in marriage licenses issued",
    x = "Date",
    y = "Number of Marriage Licenses",
    caption = "Source: Your Dataset"
  ) +  # Custom titles and labels
  theme_minimal(base_size = 15) +  # Base text size
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", size = 18),  # Bold title
    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 14, margin = margin(b = 10)),
    axis.title.x = element_text(margin = margin(t = 10)),
    axis.title.y = element_text(margin = margin(r = 10)),
    panel.grid.major = element_line(color = "grey80", size = 0.5),
    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()  # Hide minor gridlines
  )
  
Enhancements:
Line and point styling: A thicker line with a custom color and additional points for better visibility of individual data points.
Title and labels: Added a descriptive title, subtitle, and labels for both axes.
Theme adjustments: Used a minimalist theme but customized the text size, title styles, and gridlines for a cleaner look.
This should give the plot a more polished and professional appearance!
